### For this tutorial I'm gonna show you how to make a simple script that fetch URL parameters


    We need to define the parameters that we will use in a script, in this example
    will create a script that will echo our name.
    
    
### Step 1: 
    First we need to define a variable called name that is where are data will
    be stored after fetching the data from a url

### Step 2:
    In order to fetch the data from the url we need to use $_REQUEST followed by the url variable -> 'name'

### Step 3:
 > To run the script that we made we have to upload it or host it to a virtual server, in this example
 > I use [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to host the test file.
  
### Step 4:
    We need to access the file to the hosted directory since I'm using xampp i'll just need to access
    it in localhost

### Step 5:
    We need to define the variable that we will use, in 'Step 2' we use the url variable 'name'
    so in order to make the script working we just need to define the url variable name and assign
    value to it
    in this example we assigned the value tester to the url variable

    If you have correctly followed all the steps the result should look like  this.
    You can name the variable to anyting that you like and you can also store whatever data that you want
    in your url variable
